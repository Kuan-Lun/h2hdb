## Q & A

- How to use Komga?
See [Rainie's article](https://home.gamer.com.tw/artwork.php?sn=5659465).

- How to find library IDs in Komga?
To find your library ID, log into komga's library. Look at the URL in your browserâ€™s address bar, which will be formatted like this: `[base_url]/libraries/[library_id]/series`. In this URL, the `[library_id]` part is your library ID.

- Why aren't the tags for CBZ-files in Komga updated?
When you first run `H2HDB`, it generates CBZ-files. These CBZ-files are not immediately visible in Komga's library. To update them, you have two options: you can either click the 'scan library files' button in Komga, or you can run `H2HDB` twice. The first run scans the library, and the second run updates the tags.

- Why are some images missing from the CBZ-files?
`H2HDB` does not compress images that are considered spam according to certain rules. If you encounter any images that you believe should have been included, please report the issue.

- Why are some images in some CBZ files and not in other CBZ-files?
`H2HDB` learns the spam rule from the previous CBZ files. If you kill the CBZ files containing these images, the new CBZ files will not contain these images.
